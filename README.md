Greetings and salutations ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub page. I'm Virginia, a budding software engineer. After beginning my career in finance, I decided to make a switch and enrolled in coding bootcamp - shoutout Tech Elevator! The rest is, as they say, history. I'm a full stack developer who's been working in the industry for two years.
